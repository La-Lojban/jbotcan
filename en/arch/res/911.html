			 <p>J.B. Rye is known as the author of the website &quot;Learn Not To Speak Esperanto&quot; (<a href="http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/</a>)&#44; probably the most outspoken criticism of Esperanto on the internet. Reply to this has been made by the Esperantist Claude Piron (<a href="http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/why.htm" rel="nofollow">http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/why.htm</a>).</p><p>I&#39;ve heard that there are a substantial number of Esperanto speakers in Lojbanistan. I would be very interested to know your views on this exchange between Rye and Piron.</p><p>I am personally skeptical of Esperanto&#39;s alleged potential as a &#39;universal language&#39;. What can Lojbanists say about the prospect of Esperanto?</p>

			 <p>Rye&#39;s criticism is too opinionated.</p><p>BTW&#44; the phoneme inventory of Lojban is almost identical to that of Esperanto. The only differences are that Esperanto lacks Lojban&#39;s &quot;y&quot; phoneme and takes &quot;ts&quot;&#44; &quot;tc&quot; and &quot;dj&quot; as single phonemes&#44; and Lojban merges Esperanto&#39;s i/j and u/Å­ as single phonemes.</p>

			<blockquote>
			 <p>I don&#39;t agree with all of Rye&#39;s opinions about the faults of Esperanto&#44; but it&#39;s still my favorite rant about Esperanto&#44; partly because he argues without falling into major fallacies. Piron&#39;s reply&#44; for example&#44; contains the following sentence in its conclusion: &quot;He has failed to comprehend its basic feature&#44; and this vitiates his whole approach&#44; even if part of his criticism is valid and sensible.&quot; This is a major fallacy: being wrong about some thing(s) doesn&#39;t mean that valid and sensible criticism from the same person can be ignored. (Which also means <em>I</em> can&#39;t ignore the valid points Claude Piron makes.)</p><p>Rye&#39;s criticisms seem (to me) to boil down to several requirements for a &quot;universal language&quot;:</p><ol><li>Rules must all be clearly established.</li><li>Rules must be as simple as possible&#44; given that you have to be able to express anything you want to.</li><li>Vocabulary and rules must be easily learnable to as many people as possible.</li></ol><p>Rye suggests&#44; among other things&#44; that Esperanto should have a much more complete set of rules (#1)&#44; that a completely isolating language would be better for #2 and #3&#44; and that Esperanto&#39;s vocabulary could use a major overhaul to help it with #3.</p><p>Personally&#44; I don&#39;t think a &quot;universal language&quot; is particularly needed. Having one which satisfied the above requirements and which everyone in the world used would be nice&#44; but we&#39;re getting along alright with clunky natural languages only used by hundreds of millions of people each. To quote Rye: &quot;... but I still get e-mails denying the existence of any other international language. From foreign countries. In English.&quot; (Note which language Claude Piron used. And which language we&#39;re using.)</p>

			 <p>I don&#39;t know about fallacies&#44; but reading nonsense like this puts me off to take him seriously:</p><p>&quot;Even Klingon appears to be outselling Esperanto round here.&quot; Unless he wants to appeal to &quot;appears&quot; to justify himself&#44; what does that mean?</p><p>&quot;It looks like some sort of wind-up-toy Czech/Italian pidgin.&quot; What?</p><p>&quot;Natural languages have rules determining what sounds are accepted as forms of what phoneme.&quot; He has that backwards. What forms are accepted as forms of what phonemes is what allows to define the rules&#44; not the other way around.</p><p>&quot;Esperanto speakers show no agreement about whether it even has such rules.&quot; Of course it has rules&#44; how else could speakers understand one another? And it is a fact that they do understand one another&#44; that can be tested empirically. That he was not able to find the rules written down somewhere&#44; or even perhaps that nobody has written them down to his satisfaction&#44; is neither here nor there.</p><p>&quot;(And the ones writing to me seem particularly unwilling to agree on whether inter-word glottal stops are compulsory&#44; optional&#44; or prohibited.)&quot; So why doesn&#39;t he do some research instead of relying on hearsay? Obviously whether they are compulsory&#44; optional or prohibited is a matter to be found by doing research&#44; studying how speakers use the language.</p><p>&quot;But surveys say distinctions like /v/-vs-/w/&#44; /ts/-vs-/tS/&#44; /z/-vs-/Z/&#44; /h/-vs-/x/ are statistically rare&#44; so it&#39;s the people who find Esperanto&#39;s sounds strange and awkward who are being objective!&quot; [citation needed]&#44; as a wikipedian might say.</p><p>&quot;This crazed inventory is a splendid demonstration of Dr Z&#39;s linguistic incompetence;&quot; Ad hominem. (Interesting that it applies to the creators of Lojban as well.)</p><p>&quot;Zamenhof&#39;s efforts to disguise Esperanto as Italian by adding final vowels are miserably inadequate.&quot; Where did that come from?</p><p>&quot;The whole problem is that Zamenhof mistook his own prejudices about &quot;euphony&quot; for a globally accepted standard of phonotactic elegance.&quot; He seems to know a lot about Zamenhof&#39;s psychology...</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s pathetic!  Zamenhof didn&#39;t just give his brainchild a bad phonotactic system; he failed to recognise it needed any!&quot; Zamenhof was not a linguist&#44; and he was working at the end of the 19th century&#44; not today. He did give it a phonotactic system&#44; he just gave it implicitly&#44; not explicitly.  </p><p>&quot;... and they still look rotten to me.&quot; OK. </p><p>&quot;Strangest of all&#44; though&#44; is the prefix &lt;mal-&gt;&#44; a meaning-reverser like Newspeak &quot;un-&quot;.&quot; Newspeak &quot;un-&quot;? Doesn&#39;t he know about good old English &quot;un-&quot;?</p><p>&quot;&quot;Basic English&quot; cut its essential vocabulary to 850 words;&quot; Please. </p><p>&quot;Apart from anything else&#44; where would Esperanto be if any of these languages changed their spelling systems?&quot; Is he serious?</p><p>&quot;neat but somehow risible&quot; even the things he likes he can&#39;t help himself from putting down.</p><p>&quot;The actual forms of these inflections (&lt;-os&gt;?  &lt;-inta&gt;?) are unconvincing.&quot; What?</p><p>&quot;Esperanto&#39;s phrase structure rules and so on turn out to be hardly distinguishable from the ones Zamenhof grew up with - they&#39;re pretty good simple ones&#44; but it&#39;s sheer blind luck...&quot; Again&#44; even what he finds good he has to put down.</p><p>Anyway&#44; it&#39;s hard to take him seriously when he obviously doesn&#39;t know that much about Esperanto. For some reason&#44; he seems angry with Zamenhof&#44; Esperanto&#44; and Esperantists. Esperanto is not perfect&#44; it can certainly be criticized&#44; but this rant is not very serious.</p>
