Logical connectives always connect two bridi&#44; &quot;na&quot;/&quot;naku&quot; always negates a bridi&#44; and quantifiers always quantify a bridi. The difference is in the order in which they do it. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; It&#39;s an important property of the language&#44; since it makes it easier to find the predicate logic equivalent of some Lojban expressions.</blockquote><p>My rules make it easier to find the predicate logic equivalent. CLL rules make it harder&#44; because they are more arbitrary&#44; so one never knows for sure what the rules are supposed to be. There isn&#39;t one simple rule like &quot;every operator has scope over all following operators acting on the same bridi&quot;.</p><p>How do you know&#44; for example&#44; that:</p><p>ro da poi prami ro de cu censa <br />= ro da zo&#39;u ganai ro de zo&#39;u da prami de gi da censa</p><p>and not:</p><p>ro da poi prami ro de cu censa <br />= ro da zo&#39;u ro de zo&#39;u ganai da prami de gi da censa</p><p>(Are we even sure that&#39;s the CLL rule?)</p><p>After all&#44; CLL tells us that:</p><p>ro da zo&#39;u ganai da prami ro de gi da censa<br />=roda rode zo&#39;u ganai da prami de gi da censa</p><p>How do we know&#44; if we don&#39;t pay attention to the syntax&#44; whether the &quot;ro&quot; inside the relative clause has scope restricted to the relative clause bridi and not wider?  </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt;&gt; Surface order reflects scope order: what comes later is within the scope of what came first.</blockquote><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; Why? </blockquote><p>Because that way you never run into inconsistencies. You don&#39;t have to introduce new rules at every step to cover cases that were not covered before.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I don&#39;t see any reason not to allow operators which have scope over previous things (e.g. infix operators)&#44; </blockquote><p>Infix (afterthought) operators have scope over their arguments&#44; of course. They are always strictly equivalent to their forethought form. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; or syntactic constructs which have a semantic scope larger than their syntactic scope&#44; or semantic operators which have a backwards-extending scope larger than their syntatic scope.</blockquote><p>The only reason is simplicity. You know what to expect. You don&#39;t need to learn a new rule for every new case. </p><p>For example&#44; what happens with quantifiers inside abstractions? Do you know what the CLL rule about them is? You will probably have to check&#44; because in principle it could be anything. There is no general rule that you can trust. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; Why should the semantics of Lojban be restricted by the context-free grammar used for the syntax of Lojban? </blockquote><p>It isn&#39;t always&#44; in fact. The question should rather be: why go against the syntax when there doesn&#39;t seem to be any reason given for doing so? If there was a good reason for playing around with the scopes of negation and quantifiers&#44; then I might go along with it. But there isn&#39;t any reason given. It just happened that someone who didn&#39;t understand very well what he was doing came up with some crazy rules just because.  </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; For example&#44; setting a sticky tense gives that tense a semantic scope extending well beyond its syntactic scope.</blockquote><p>Yes.

It is an unexpected rule. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I would say the default option should be to go with the standard&#44; and if any proposal for change is made&#44; evidence for the new proposal and against the standard would be needed before counter-arguments would be required.</blockquote><p>Yes&#44; from to point of view of the reformer that would be right. I&#39;m taking the point of view of the learner: someone new to Lojban but familiar with predicate logic. They are told that the rule for interpreting quantifiers is not what the syntax suggests but something else. Naturally they would want to know why.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; You&#39;ve obviously passed that threshold already&#44; but I&#39;m fairly certain your proposal hasn&#39;t been accepted as the standard yet&#44; so you still have to defend your proposal.</blockquote><p>Well... I&#39;m fairly certain a large majority of Lojbanists&#44; including the author of CLL&#44; would interpret &quot;noda xamgu prane ije node xlali prane&quot; in the way I suggest&#44; CLL notwithstanding. That&#39;s just my impression&#44; of course&#44; and we would have to make the experiment to see if I&#39;m right or not. Our discussion here is&#44; fortunately or unfortunately depending on how we consider it&#44; mostly academic. It will likely have no impact on the actual use of Lojban. This is based on many similar discussions I have had in the past. These issues don&#39;t really come up in actual usage&#44; and if by chance they do&#44; nobody is very sure about what&#39;s what.  </p><p>Very few Lojbanists&#44; if anyone&#44; are actually aware of the implications of that rule. In fact I had forgotten that example was there in CLL&#44; and the first time I read it I assumed it was just an erratum. The rule is more likely to be invoked when there is a shared variable that appears in both bridi&#44; but I&#39;m pretty certain the case where the two bridi didn&#39;t have a shared variable was not even considered at the time that was written.   </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; In your version of Lojban&#44; if you want to use the same variable in different parts of a logical connective&#44; you have to explicitly put it in a prenex with scope over the entire connective. </blockquote><p>Yes&#44; exactly.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; Expressions in CLL standard Lojban can always be rewritten to get rid of all explicit prenexes.</blockquote><p>Not quite always. For example&#44; you can&#39;t get rid of the prenex in:</p><p>su&#39;o da zo&#39;u mi djica lo nu mi ponse da </p><p>But you were probably referring to expressions without subordinate bridi. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; There. Is that a clear enough statement of a general problem with your proposal for you?</blockquote><p>But why is it a problem that some expressions require a prenex? What is so problematic about prenexes? Are they so problematic that we want to sacrifice clarity in exchange for not having to use them?</p>

The relative order of naku and quantifiers is respected in that case&#44; but not in the case when the outermost bridi is different from the innermost. </p><p>You also need to say something about the order of negation and connectives: &quot;naku ko&#39;a .e ko&#39;e broda&quot; and &quot;ko&#39;a .e ko&#39;e naku broda&quot; mean different things.

In &quot;su&#39;oda na blabi gi&#39;e xekri&quot;&#44; &quot;su&#39;o&quot; has scope over &quot;na&quot;.

The meaning of NA doesn&#39;t depend on context.</blockquote><p>The meaning of na/naku doesn&#39;t depend on context&#44; it always negates a bridi. It is its scope (&quot;which bridi?&quot;) that depends on context. This happens both with CLL or my rules&#44; and for all operators. The difference is that I give one rule that applies to all operators equally&#44; CLL gives a different rule for each kind of operator.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I think the main thing bothering you is that the quantifiers operate on the outermost bridi&#44; and possibly the bit about operators attached to selbri being evaluated first.</blockquote><p>Yes&#44; because I see no reason to make rules for quantifiers different to rules for conectives different to rules for negators/unary operators. It can be done&#44; of course&#44; and the result is a mess. It is that mess that bothers me. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; But nu is different from du&#39;u. </blockquote><p>They are different&#44; yes&#44; but not&#44; I think&#44; in a relevant way with respect to scopes of quantifiers.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; &quot;mi djuno lo du&#39;u ...&quot; effectively says you think the contents of the du&#39;u bridi evaluate </blockquote><p>to &#39;true&#39;. </p><p>Right.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; But &quot;mi zgana lo nu ...&quot; says you observed a physical event described by the contents of the nu abstraction.</blockquote><p>Right. An event for which the contents of the bridi evaluate to true.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I&#39;m going to simplify the example even further: the bag contains one ball and one cube.</blockquote><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; nu pa da zo&#39;u do jgari da<br />&gt; == nu gonai do jgari le bolci gi do jgari le kubli</blockquote><p>Right.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; pa da zo&#39;u nu do jgari da</blockquote><p>== gonai nu do jgari le bolci gi do jgari le kubli</p><p>(You missed a &quot;nu&quot;:)</p><p>== gonai nu do jgari le bolci gi nu do jgari le kubli</p><p>Yes.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I figure that observing an event of the ball xor the cube being grasped implies observing an event of the ball being grasped xor observing an event of the cube being grasped&#44; and vice-versa.</blockquote><p>Not necessarily. You may be able to distinguish that exactly one of the two objects was grabbed without being able to distinguish which one&#44; in which case the first is true and the second false.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; However&#44; I still concede that using abstractions can make it effectively impossible to eliminate some prenexes. </blockquote><p>OK.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; The point that the CLL rules allow one to translate logic into more compact Lojban more often still stands.</blockquote><p>The claim is still hard to justify.

(If you do&#44; I&#39;d be happy to learn something new.) The best I can do is point out that any expression which doesn&#39;t require a prenex under your rules&#44; also doesn&#39;t require a prenex under CLL rules&#44; but some CLL expressions which don&#39;t require a prenex&#44; do under your rules.

You also need to specify how to do the expansion of logical quantifiers in the presence of connectives: {ga ko&#39;a gi ko&#39;e prami ro da} -&gt; {ga ko&#39;a prami ro da gi ko&#39;e prami da}&#44; and not {ga ko&#39;a prami ro da gi ko&#39;e prami ro da/de} which is how I would do it. (The change of variable is not actually required&#44; but just to emphasize that they are independently bound variables.)   </p><p>BTW&#44; do you treat &quot;roroi&quot; as a quantifier or as a tag&#44; given that it is both? </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I interpret the second as meaning that one of those two events was observed&#44; and that it&#39;s true even if the observation wasn&#39;t clear enough to distinguish between the two.</blockquote><p>How&#44; then&#44; would you distinguish between &quot;for exactly one of the objects I observed that <em>it</em> was grabbed&quot; vs. &quot;I observed that exactly one of the objects was grabbed (but not which one)&quot;.  </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I don&#39;t know how to quantify the number of cases where a prenex can be eliminated under CLL rules but not under yours. (If you do&#44; I&#39;d be happy to learn something new.)</blockquote><p>Easy&#44; it&#39;s infinite. :)</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; The best I can do is point out that any expression which doesn&#39;t require a prenex under your rules&#44; also doesn&#39;t require a prenex under CLL rules&#44; </blockquote><p>We already found one that did: &quot;mi djuno lo du&#39;u do pu jgari pa bolci&quot; does not require a prenex with my rules&#44; but you do need a prenex to express the same thing with yours.</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; but some CLL expressions which don&#39;t require a prenex&#44; do under your rules. Therefore&#44; the number of cases where prenexes are required under your rules is strictly greater than the number of cases where prenexes are required under CLL rules.</blockquote><p>Both numbers are infinite&#44; so it doesn&#39;t really make sense to say one is greater than the other. I think you mean that the set of cases that require a prenex under CLL is a proper subset of the set of cases that require a prenex under my rules. That&#39;s not true under your interpretation above for quantifiers inside du&#39;u. But even if that were true&#44; that still would not necessarily make the expressions more compact. </p><p>Consider this example:</p><p>mi pendo su&#39;o prenu poi se bangu no fange</p><p>Under my interpretation&#44; this means:<br />&quot;I am friends with someone who speaks no foreign language.&quot;</p><p>Under your interpretation&#44; I&#39;m not very sure what it means.

Not what &quot;mi pendo su&#39;o prenu poi se bangu no fange&quot; means with my rules. </p><p>So how do we get that meaning with your rules? The wanted prenex form is:  </p><p>su&#39;o da poi prenu zo&#39;u ge mi pendo da gi no de poi fange zo&#39;u da se bangu de<br />==su&#39;o da poi prenu zo&#39;u ge mi pendo da gi ro de poi fange zo&#39;u da na se bangu de<br />==su&#39;o da poi prenu ku&#39;o ro de poi fange zo&#39;u ge mi pendo da gi da na se bangu de<br />==su&#39;o da poi prenu ku&#39;o ro de poi fange zo&#39;u ge mi pendo da gi da na se bangu de<br />==ge mi pendo su&#39;o da poi prenu gi da na se bangu ro de poi fange<br />== mi pendo su&#39;o prenu poi na se bangu ro fange </p><p>So your prenex-less expression is in this case (slightly) longer than mine. </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; Eliminating a prenex saves&#44; at a minimum&#44; a DA word&#44; a &quot;zo&#39;u&quot;&#44; the space between them&#44; and the space after &quot;zo&#39;u&quot;. So&#44; a minimum of 8 characters saved per prenex eliminated&#44; and more for each additional variable in the prenex&#44; especially when &quot;ku&#39;o&quot; terminators are required between them.</blockquote><p>Only if the variables in the matrix appear in the right order. If they don&#39;t&#44; you may need to add characters to re-order the variables before eliminating the prenex.  </p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt; I suspect the most affected texts are statements translated directly from logic into Lojban. Other than that&#44; I don&#39;t have enough data to guess how &quot;the average length of a Lojban text&quot; (which one?) would be affected. </blockquote><p>A generic Lojban text. A specific text won&#39;t have a relevant &quot;average length&quot;. My guess is that the answer is &quot;very little&quot; or &quot;insignificantly&quot;. (You can pick any random Lojban text around and check. It probably won&#39;t be affected at all by any of this.)</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt;But I think it&#39;s reasonable for Lojban to have rules which make it easy to translate statements from formal logic into compact Lojban&#44; if only to encourage the use of logic in Lojban.</blockquote><p>Totally! That&#39;s why I object to CLL rules&#44; which make that task <em>complicated</em> instead of simple. </p>

Also things like &quot;lu&#39;i roda&quot; will need to be expanded since &quot;roda&quot; there is an argument in a hidden bridi: &quot;lu&#39;i roda&quot; -&gt; &quot;lo selcmi be roda&quot; -&gt; &quot;zo&#39;e noi ke&#39;a selcmi roda&quot;. Presumably these don&#39;t need special mention in your rules either&#44; because they would first be expanded to full bridi-form and then treated accordingly. </p><p>But you do need to say what to do with relative clauses. If &quot;ro da poi &lt;bridi&gt; cu broda&quot; is to imply &quot;ro da poi &lt;bridi&gt; zo&#39;u ganai &lt;bridi&gt; gi broda&quot;&#44; what will happen with any quantifiers inside &lt;bridi&gt;? Will they have scope over &quot;ganai ... gi ...&quot;? </p>
