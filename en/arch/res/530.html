I do not know if I am being terribly clear&#44; it makes sense to me&#44; so ask me to clarify or re-explain a point.</p><p>[zo mlatu] is a brivla (relation-word).  It may function as a bridi&#44; selbri&#44; or sumti.  Think of bridi as big metal blocks with little square holes in them.  The whole block encompasses every aspect of the relationship.  Stamped on the block is an identification-word&#44; the selbri.  This tells what precisely is the relation of the block&#44; but not what is being related.  The holes (really&#44; they are indents&#44; in my mind) are terbri&#44; they describe what may be related.  Sumti may be thought of as little blocks&#44; of a slightly different colour.  They have stamps on them too.  These stamps are the identification-words&#44; basically what the sumti is (named&#44; described as&#44; etc.)  Fill the big block in with these little blocks&#44; and you have a complete bridi.  But&#44; if you do not&#44; a solid wedge gets stuck in each terbri hole (this is by default); this is [zo zo&#39;e].  This makes the terbri hole filled up without giving it any real meaning.  If the block is completely filled with such wedges&#44; then the selbri basically becomes the entire bridi&#44; because it is the only thing described on the block.</p><p>The sumti blocks that fill in the terbri of the bridi actually have little holes in them too (yes&#44; these holes <em>are</em> terbri).  The first one is filled by a gadri&#44; which tells you how that sumti is to be interpreted.  The sumti block is stamped&#44; as said before&#44; with an identification-word- which is the relationship between the gadri and the other terbri’s sumti.  So it (the stamp) is a selbri.  We have now just discovered that sumti are really there own little bridi!  But unlike the previous bridi&#44; when all the terbri holes are filled up (one way or another)&#44; the relationship does not end.  That entire meaning is rolled up and act as an argument for the main bridi (or the sumti’s terbri holes are filled in&#44; and then the entire sumti block is slid into a terbri hole of the next&#44; more encompassing bridi).  Even the things that fill in the terbri of a sumti have holes.  So the process may continue indefinitely (or until&#44; as the L4B says (or I am attempting to paraphrase&#44; at least)&#44; your brain overheats).</p><p>One may also add details to these bridi&#44; such as attitudinals.  Attitudinals color the word immediately before them.  Think of gadri as the head of a sumti&#44; [zo .i] as the head of a bridi&#44; and [zo cu] (in some cases) as the head of a selbri.  If one puts an attitudinal right after one of these words&#44; then it puts a funny hat on the whole rest of its &quot;body&quot; (the sumti&#44; bridi&#44; or selbri respectively).  However&#44; if one puts an attitudinal right after a different type of word&#44; the funny little hat becomes a parka and only applies to that word.  So the hats crown an entire thing&#44; but parkas only cover a certain section of the body.  [zo’o] Maybe it would have been easier to explain using a bodysuit instead of a hat…</p><p>Other such details include tanru.  tanru are words that describe another word (like adjectives or adverbs).  They paint the main word (called a &quot;tertau&quot;) different colors and patterns&#44; or (if you prefer) give it different tastes and aromas.  They group together in twos and paint from left to right (by default) the next word&#44; which then itself may become part of a tanru (adding its meaning/color&#44; when painted&#44; to another word).  They may be used on any selbri (which means sumti and a bridi’s selbri).</p><p>Last&#44; there are clauses.  Clauses pin a tail onto the selbri (which may act as a sumti in a bigger bridi) that may restrict its meaning or add additional information that is not specifically provided for in the terbri holes (you can think of terbri holes having little labels under them describing what this particular value is in the overall relation&#44; like slots for letters to be stored in a post office before delivery).  Luckily&#44; terbri holes are not like holes or indentations in real life.  They automatically accommodate any sized or shaped object that want to be accommodated there; but can&#44; at most only be filled by one.  So you may add a tail or bulge to a cubic sumti block&#44; and it still can fit into the same terbri hole.  Round object can easily slide into any size of square hole&#44; in Lojban.</p><p>Additionally&#44; sumti may be snapped together (like Legos) using words known collectively as “connectives”.  Think of them snapped vertically on top of eachother&#44; so the holes do not need to stretch to fit them.  How these snappings “snap” depends on how the words snapped together depend on or influence eachother’s existence.  If both need to be present&#44; then the snap will be an “AND”-statement.  If  on does not depend on the other&#44; then it will be a “WHETHER OR NOT”-statement.  If only one can exist&#44; then it is a “EXCLUSIVE OR”-statement.  If they can exist in harmony with eachother but it does not really faze them if the other is not there&#44; think of it as an “AND/OR”-statement.  When one unit snaps together with another&#44; then for the purpose of the bridi/relationship (but not for reference)&#44; they are treated as a single thing.  And since sumti are a type of bridi with a specific function and since sumti can be snapped together&#44; other word types may be napped together as well.  Such snapping include: those in which one sumti has two or more bridi that apply&#44; tanru (which contain bridi) that depend or influence eachother’s existence for the same selbri (sumti also)&#44; and multiple bridi somehow strung together.</p><p>Spacetime tenses relate a modified word to another in some manner through space and/or time.</p>  </blockquote>       <table><tbody><tr><td class="doubledash">&gt;&gt;</td> <td class="reply" id="reply532"> <a name="532"></a> <label><input type="checkbox" name="delete" value="532" /> <span class="replytitle"></span>  <span class="commentpostername">.kriltic.</span> 08/11/11(Tue)03:15</label> <span class="reflink">  <a href="javascript:insert('&gt;&gt;532')">No.532</a> </span>&nbsp;  <blockquote> <p><a href="https://jbotcan.org/en/res/530.html" onclick="highlight(530)">&gt;&gt;530</a> </p><p>Oh&#44; and sumtcita drill new holes into a bridi block and write a label/address beneath them.</p>  </blockquote> </td></tr></tbody></table>   <br clear="left" /><hr />  <table class="userdelete"><tbody><tr><td> <input type="hidden" name="task" value="delete" /> Delete Post [<label><input type="checkbox" name="fileonly" value="on" />File Only</label>]<br /> Password <input type="password" name="password" size="8" /> <input value="Delete" type="submit" /></td></tr></tbody></table> </form> <script type="text/javascript">set_delpass("delform")</script>  <p class="footer"> - <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/">wakaba 3.0.7</a> + <a href="http://www.2chan.net/">futaba</a> + <a href="http://www.1chan.net/futallaby/">futallaby</a> -</p> </body></html>
