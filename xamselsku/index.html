  <div>
    <pre>&lt;Broca&gt; Well, I for one like having my dreams come true. :-)
&lt;Eimi&gt; You must have very different dreams from mine.
&lt;Eimi&gt; Some of mine are very enjoyable indeed, but if they started to occur in what I normally
       think of as reality I would be terrified indeed.  For one thing, it would mean that
       everyone who's told me anything about physics was either tragically ignorant or a horrible

    <pre>&lt;Eimi&gt; Idea for someone with way too much time on their hands: create a parallel complaint about English, in lojban.  Complain about how "give me the ball" and "give me to the ball" are so different, and how you have to use BAI-like prepositions for *everything*, etc etc.

    <pre>&lt;jcowan&gt; piblitki is not a proper lujvo: it's tosmabru.
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; hm, jvocu'adju says it's ok
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; probably because tk is not a permissible start cluster or something?
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; which makes no sense either…
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; hm, yes it does. tki cannot be a rafsi.
&lt;jcowan&gt; I guess that's right.  I never thought about whether the tosmabru rule applies to the case where a CV falls off and leaves a fu'ivla behind, but I guess it doesn't.
&lt;jcowan&gt; But is that really right?  How can you tell "piblitki" from the valid "pi blitki"?
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; there can be no blitki.
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; at least that's what jbofi'e says
&lt;selbeimanti&gt; so, why can't blitki be a fu'ivla ?
&lt;jcowan&gt; Oh.  Because it's a slinku'i.  "ca blitki" = "cablitki", a well-formed tanru.

&lt; Warrigal&gt; Surely real skates are the ones where the wheels all lie in a line.  If they're spread out across the plane, that makes them complex skates.

&lt;jcowan&gt; And still ranting?  Impressive.
&lt;djanatyn&gt; Umm.
&lt;djanatyn&gt; (my *computer* speaker is dead).

    <pre>* lindar is all for being vague and leaving out as much subject matter as possible.
 * lindar could be a mafia boss.
&lt; lindar&gt; D'you take care of the first thing?
&lt; lindar&gt; How about the second thing?
&lt; lindar&gt; Did you do the thing with the other thing?
&lt; lis_nunyn&gt; I feel very slightly confused now about ku/cu
&lt; lis_nunyn&gt; Basically, if you could make that a tanru, then you need one, right?
&lt; xalbo&gt; Yes.  Or at least, that's the most common place where a {ku} would be needed.
&lt; lis_nunyn&gt; so, mi sedlki is fine because that can't be a tanru.
&lt; xalbo&gt; Right.
&lt; lis_nunyn&gt; (you can ask lindar how I wound up in a bag)</pre>

    <pre>&lt; xalbo&gt; The {ban} in {lojban} is "bon" or (much more rarely, but still legally and amusingly) "bong".
