I made a variation of Elian Script for use with Lojban and English. It is very similar to Lindar's in terms of layout so you can write with both, and they will be easy to distinguish, but also easy to remember. The blank spot is, in fact, a space character for use in case things seem to run together too much. There is no apostrophe because it's taken up by H to support Lojban. If you want to use apostrophes in your English writing you can either make a line that is completely straight, or use a triangle or some other character that's obviously not a mark. Or, do as I do, and just use the H/' character but make it smaller and put it near the top. It's easy to distinguish.
